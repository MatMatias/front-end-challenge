<h2>OneRPM Frontend challenge | Angular + Node</h2>
<p>Frontend: Angular | Backend: node + express</p>
<p>
  Besides this being a frontend challenge, a backend was necessary because it
  wasn't possible to authenticate in spotify Web API via client-side. This is because
  it would expose the Spotify Web API Secret key. So, a web service was created
  in Node in order to prevent that. It's purpose is to serve as a proxy that
  wrap all client-side requests to the Spotify Web API, handling authentication
  in this proccess.
