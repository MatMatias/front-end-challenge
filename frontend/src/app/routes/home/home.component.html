    <h1>OneRPM Frontend Challenge</h1>
    <h2>Frontend: Angular | Backend: NodeJS + Express</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Besides this being a frontend challenge, a backend was necessary because it
    wasn't possible to authenticate in spotify Web API via client-side. This is
    because it would expose the Spotify Web API Secret key. So, a web service
    was created in Node in order to prevent that. It's purpose is to serve as a
    proxy that wrap all client-side requests to the Spotify Web API, handling
    authentication in this proccess.
